## Project 1: [preprint average sentences](https://github.com/Olya-M/preprint-average-sentences)
For this project I made a made a preprint summarizer that helps get a quick overview of a preprints for a biomed topic. The summarizer scrapes preprints for a searched topic, returns the most average sentence for each preprint, and clusters similar preprints together. Each preprint can then be skimmed by reading the most average sentence per paragraph.

## Project 2: [hand gesture recognition for computer navigation](https://github.com/Olya-M/gestures-recognition)
* trained a gesture recognition model using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Pytorch Lightning
* trained the model to recognize 26 different hand gestures
* set up gestures recognition events (such as using a mouse, changing the volume, or changing tabs) using AutoPy, pynput, and pycaw.
